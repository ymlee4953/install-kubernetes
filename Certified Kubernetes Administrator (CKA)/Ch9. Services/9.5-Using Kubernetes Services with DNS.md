# **Using Kubernetes Services with DNS**
## **Introduction**
Kubernetes Services can be located with the Kubernetes DNS just like Pods can. In this lab, you will work with the Kubernetes DNS to discover Services from within a Pod. This will test your knowledge of how to interact with Services using DNS.

## **Solution**
Log in to the control plane server using the credentials provided:

        ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>

### **Perform an Nslookup for a Service in the Same Namespace**
1. Start using the busybox Pod in the web namespace to perform an nslookup on the web-frontend Service by entering:

        kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup web-frontend

2. Redirect the output to save the results in a text file by using:

        kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup web-frontend >> ~/dns_same_namespace_results.txt

3. Look up the same Service using the fully qualified domain name by entering:

        kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup web-frontend.web.svc.cluster.local

4. Redirect the output to save the results of the second nslookup in a text file by using:

        kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup web-frontend.web.svc.cluster.local >> ~/dns_same_namespace_results.txt
5. Check that everything looks okay in the text file by using:

        cat ~/dns_same_namespace_results.txt
6. Use clear to clear the text file output.

### **Perform an Nslookup For a Service in a Different Namespace**
1. Use the busybox Pod in the web namespace to perform an nslookup on the user-db Service in the data namespace, while only utilizing the short Service name, by entering:

        kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup user-db

    This first request is supposed to result in an error message, so don't be alarmed if you see that we can't resolve user-db.

2. Save the results of this nslookup in a text file by using:

        kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup user-db >> ~/dns_different_namespace_results.txt

3. Perform the same lookup using the fully qualified domain name by entering:

        kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup user-db.data.svc.cluster.local

4. Save the results in a text file by using:

        kubectl exec -n web busybox -- nslookup user-db.data.svc.cluster.local >> ~/dns_different_namespace_results.txt
5. Check the output in the text file by using:

        cat ~/dns_different_namespace_results.txt

## **Conclusion**
Congratulations â€” you've completed this hands-on lab!
